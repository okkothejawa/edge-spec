## Codesize

This document details the different options for codesize optimization. Generally, codesize and
runtime efficiency are inversely correlated. Developers will have granular control both in the
compiler's configuration and in the language's syntax.

### Inlining Heuristics

Function inlining is a direct tradeoff of codesize and runtime efficiency. Codesize optimization may
be used for reducing deployment cost or for keeping the codesize below the EVM's codesize limit.

#### Scoring

Functions are assigned a score based on a combination of its projected bytecode size, projected
number of calls, and an optional manually entered score.

| Name          | Score                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Bytecode Size | `fn.bytecode.len()`                          |
| Call Count    | `fn.calls()`                                 |
| Manual Score  | `u8`                                         |
| Total         | `(fn.bytecode.len() + 5 * fn.calls()) * man` |

A compiler configuration can be specified for the threshold for function inlining.

#### Analysis

The analysis for function inline scoring requires the traveral of a directed graph containing each
function and other functions called within it. Traversal is depth first, as function inline scores
are dependent on their bytecode size which is dependent on the inline scores of functions called
within its body. Once a terminal function, a function with no internal function dependencies, is
found, its inline score will be compared against the configuration threshold. If the score is
greater than the threshold, it is to be inlined and a flag will be stored in the graph for future
references.

Cycle detection will both prevent infinite loops in the compiler as well as detect recursion and
corecursion. Recursive and corecursive functions will never be inlined for simplicity.

### Dead Code Elimination

Eliminating dead code will cut codesize and improve the function inlining score, as number of calls
and projected codesize of each function are both factors in the function inline score.
