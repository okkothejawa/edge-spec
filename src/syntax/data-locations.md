## Data Locations

```ebnf
<storage_pointer> ::= "&s" ;
<transient_storage_pointer> ::= "&t" ;
<memory_pointer> ::= "&m" ;
<calldata_pointer> ::= "&cd" ;
<returndata_pointer> ::= "&rd" ;
<internal_code_pointer> ::= "&ic" ;
<external_code_pointer> ::= "&ec" ;

<data_location> ::=
    | <storage_pointer>
    | <transient_storage_pointer>
    | <memory_pointer>
    | <calldata_pointer>
    | <returndata_pointer>
    | <internal_code_pointer>
    | <external_code_pointer> ;
```

The `<location>` is a data location annotation indicating to which data location a pointer's data
exists. We define seven distinct annotations for data location pointers. This is a divergence from
general purpose programming languages to more accurately represent the EVM execution environment.

- `&s` persistent storage
- `&t` transient storage
- `&m` memory
- `&cd` calldata
- `&rd` returndata
- `&ic` internal (local) code
- `&ec` external code

#### Semantics

Data locations can be grouped into two broad categories, buffers and maps.

##### Maps

Persistent and transient storage are part of the map category, 256 bit keys map to 256 bit values.
Both may be written or read one word at a time.

##### Buffers

Memory, calldata, returndata, internal code, and external code are all linear data buffers. All can
be either read to the stack or copied into memory, but only memory can be written or copied to.

| Name          | Read to Stack | Copy to Memory | Write |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| memory        | true          | true           | true  |
| calldata      | true          | true           | false |
| returndata    | false         | true           | false |
| internal code | false         | true           | false |
| external code | false         | true           | false |

##### Transitions

Transitioning from map to memory buffer is performed by loading each element from the map to the
stack and storing each stack item in memory O(N).

Transitioning from memory buffer to a map is performed by loading each element from memory to the
stack and storing each stack item in the map O(N).

Transitioning from any other buffer to a map is performed by copying the buffer's data into memory
then transitioning the data from memory into the map O(N+1).

##### Pointer Bit Sizes

Pointers to different data locations consist of different sizes based on the properties of that data
location. In depth semantics of each data location are specified in the type system documents.

| Location           | Bit Size | Reason                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| persistent storage | 256      | Storage is 256 bit key value hashmap                            |
| transient storage  | 256      | Transient storage is 256 bit key value hashmap                  |
| memory             | 32       | Theoretical maximum memory size does not grow to `0xffffffff`   |
| calldata           | 32       | Theoretical maximum calldata size does not grow to `0xffffffff` |
| returndata         | 32       | Maximum returndata size is equal to maximum memory size         |
| internal code      | 16       | Code size is less than `0xffff`                                 |
| external code      | 176      | Contains 160 bit address and 16 bit code pointer                |
