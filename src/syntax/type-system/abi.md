## ABI

The application binary interface is both a construct to generate a JSON ABI by the compiler as well
as a subtyping construct for contract objects.

### Declaration

```ebnf
<abi_declaration> ::=
    "abi" <ident> [":" <ident> ("&" <ident>)*] "{"
        (
            ["mut"] <function_declaration> ";"
        )*
    "}" ;
```

Dependencies:

- [`<function_declaration>`](function-types.md#declaration)

The `<abi_declaration>` is prefixed with "abi", followed by its identifier, then an optional colon
and list of ampersand separated identifiers, and finally a series of zero or more function
declarations optionally prefixed by "mut" and delimited by curly braces.

### Semantics

The optional "mut" keyword indicates whether the function will mutate the state of the smart
contract or the EVM. This allows contracts to determine whether to use the `call` or `staticcall`
instruction to interface with a target conforming to the given ABI.

The optional ampersand separated list of identifiers represents other ABI identifiers to enable ABI
subtyping.
