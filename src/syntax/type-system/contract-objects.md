## Contract Objects

Contract objects serve as an object-like interface to contract constructs.

### Declaration

```ebnf
<contract_field_declaration> ::= <ident> ":" <type_signature>
<contract_declaration> ::=
    "contract" <ident> "{"
        [<contract_field_declaration> ("," <contract_field_declaration>)* [","]]
    "}" ;
```

The `<contract_field_declaration>` is an identifier and type signature, separated by a colon.

The `<contract_declaration>` is the contract keyword, followed by its identifier, followed by a
curly brace delimited, comma separated list of field declarations.

### Implementation

```ebnf
<contract_impl_block> ::=
    "impl" <ident> [":" <ident>] "{"
        (["ext"] ["mut"] <function_declaration>)*
    "}"
```

The `<contract_impl_block>` is composed of the "impl" keyword, followed by its identifier,
optionally followed by a colon and abi identifier, followed by list of function declarations,
optionally "ext" and/or "mut", delimited by curly braces.

### Semantics

The contract object desugars to a single main function and storage layout with a disptacher.

Contract field declarations create the storage layout which start at zero and increment by one for
each field. Fields are never packed, however, storage packing may be achieved by declaring contract
fields as packed structs or tuples.

Contract implementation blocks contain definitions of external functions in the contract object.
If the impl block contains a colon and identifier, this indicates the impl block is satisfying an
abi's constrained functions. The "ext" keyword indicates the function is publicly exposed via the
contract's dispatcher. The "mut" keyword indicates the function may mutate the global state in the
EVM-sense; that is to say "mut" functions require a "call" instruction while those without may use
"call" or "staticcall" to interface with the contract.

> todo: revisit this. do types satisfy this instead?
