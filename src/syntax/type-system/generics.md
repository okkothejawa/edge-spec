## Generics

Generics are polymorphic types enabling function and type reuse across different types.

### Type Parameters

```ebnf
<type_parameter_single> ::= <ident> <trait_constraints> ;

<type_parameters> ::= "<" <type_parameter_single> ("," <type_parameter_single>)* [","] ">" ;
```

Dependencies:

- [`<ident>`](../identifiers.md)
- [`<trait_constraints>`](traits.md)

The `<type_parameter_single>` is an individual type parameter for parametric polymorphic types and
functions. We define this as a type name optionally followed by a trait constraint.

The `<type_parameters>` is a comma separated list of individual type parameters delimited by angle
brackets.

### Semantics

Generics are resolved at compile time through monomorphization. Generic functions and data types are
monomorphized into distinct unique functions and data types. Function duplication can become
problematic due to the EVM bytecode size limit, so a series of steps will be taken to allow for
granular control over bytecode size. Those semantics are defined in the
[Codesize document](../../semantics/codesize.md).
