## Branching

Branching refers to blocks of code that may be executed based on a defined condition.

### If Else If Branch

```ebnf
<if_else_if_branch> ::= "if" "(" <expr> ")" <code_block>
    ("else" "if" "(" <expr> ")" <code_block>)*
    ["else" <code_block>] ;
```

Dependencies:

- [`<expr>`](../expressions.md)
- [`<code_block>`](./code-block.md)

The `<branch>` contains an "if" keyword followed by a parenthesis delimited expression and a code
block. It may be followed by zero or more conditions under "else" "if" keywords followed by a
parenthesis delimited expression and a code block, and finally it may optionally be suffixed with an
"else" keyword followed by a code block.

### If Match

```ebnf
<if_match_branch> ::= "if" <pattern_match> <code_block> ;
```

Dependencies:

- [`<pattern_match>`](../type-system/sum-types.md#pattern-match)
- [`<code_block>`](code-block.md)

The `<if_match_branch>` contains a pattern match expression followed by an optionally typed
identifier followed by a code block.

### Match

```ebnf
<match_arm> ::= (<union_pattern> | <ident> | "_") "=>" <code_block> ;

<match> ::=
    "match" <expr> "{"
    [<match_arm> ("," <match_arm>)* [","]]
    "}" ;
```

Dependencies:

- [`<expr>`](../expressions.md)
- [`<union_pattern>`](../type-system/sum-types.md#union-pattern)
- [`<code_block>`](code-block.md)

The `<match_arm>` is a single arm of a match statement. It may optionally be prefixed with a union
pattern and contains a lambda.

The `<match>` statement is a group of match arms that may pattern match against an expression.

Semantics of the match statement are defined in the
[control flow semantics](../../semantics/control-flow.md).

### Ternary

```ebnf
<ternary> ::= <expr> "?" <expr> ":" <expr> ;
```

Dependencies:

- [`<expr>`](../expressions.md)

The `<ternary>` is a branching statement that takes an expression, followed by a question mark, or
ternary operator, followed by two colon separated expressions.

### Semantics

#### If Else If Branch

The expression of the "if" statement is evaluated. The type of the expression must either be a
boolean or it must be a value that can be cast to a boolean. If the result is true, the subsequent
block of code is executed. Otherwise the next branch is checked. If the optional "else if" follows,
the above process is repeated until either there are no more branches or the optional "else"
follows. If no branches have resolved to true, the "else" block is executed.

```rs
fn main() {
    let n = 3;

    if (n == 1) {
        // ..
    } else if (n == 2) {
        // ..
    } else {
        // ..
    }
}
```

#### If Match

The "if match" statement executes as the "if" statement does, however, the expression to evaluate is
a pattern match. While the [pattern match semantics](../type-system/sum-types.md#pattern-match) are
specified elsewhere, the "if match" branch brings into scope the identifier(s) of the inner type(s)
of the matched pattern.

```rs
type Union = A(u8) | B;

fn main() {
    let u = Union::A(1);

    if u matches Union::A(n) {
        assert(n == 1);
    }
}
```

#### Match

Matching requires all possible patterns for a given expression's type to be evaluated. If any
pattern is not matched in a match block, a compiler error is thrown. The semantics for match arms
are the same as those for the "if match" statement.

The remaining branches for a pattern match may be grouped together either with an identifier or if
the identifier is unnecessary, an underscore. Using an identifier assigns a subset of the associated
type into scope. The subset of the type contains one of the unmatched members. This does not create
a new distinct data type, rather it infers the non-existence of the pre-matched branches.

```rs
type Ua = A | B;
type Ub = A | B;

fn main() {
    let u_a = Ua::B;
    let u_b = Ub::B;

    match u_a {
        Ua::A => {},
        Ub::B => {},
    }

    match u_b {
        Ua::A => {},
        n => {
            // `n` inferred to have type `Ub::B`
        }
    }
}
```

#### Ternary

The ternary operator evaluates the expression, the first expression's result must be of type
boolean, and if the expression evaluates to true, the second expression is evaluated, otherwise the
third expression is evaluated.

```rs
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let mut a = 0;

    if (condition) {
        a = 1;
    } else {
        a = 2;
    }

    let b = condition ? 1 : 2;

    assert(a == b);
}
```

#### Short Circuiting

For all branch statements that evaluate a boolean expression to determine which branches to take,
the following statements hold if the expression is composed of multiple inner boolean expressions
separated by logical operators.

- if `<expr0> && <expr1>` and `<expr0>` is `false`, short circuit to `false`
- if `<expr0> || <expr1>` and `<expr0>` is `true`, short circuit to `true`

Also, for all chains of "if else if" statements, if the first evaluates to true, do not evaluate
the remaining chained statements.
