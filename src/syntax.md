## Syntax

Conceptually, all EVM contracts are single-entry point executables and at compile time, Edge
programs are no different.

Other languages have used primarily the contract-is-an-object paradigm, mapping fields to storage
layouts and methods to "external functions" that may read and write the storage. Inheritance enables
interface constraints, code reuse, and a reasonable model for message passing that relates to the
EVM external call model.

However, this is limited in scope. Conceptually, the contract object paradigm groups stateful data
and functionality, limiting the deployability to the product type. Extending the deployability to
arbitrary data types allows for contracts to be functions, type unions, product types, and more.
While most of these are not particularly useful, this simplifies the type system as well as opens
the design space to new contract paradigms.

The core syntax of Edge is derived from commonly used patterns in modern programming. Functions,
branches, and loops are largely intuitive for engineers with experience in C, Rust, Javascript, etc.
Parametric polymorphism uses syntax similar to Rust and Typescript. Compiler built-in functions and
"comptime" constructs follow the syntax of Zig.
